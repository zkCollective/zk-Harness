<h1 align="center">zk-Harness</h1>

There is a large and increasing number of libraries that enable verifiable computation with *zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs)*. 
Whereas the performance of zkSNARKs is well-understood in theory, various factors make it difficult to compare different proof systems without favoring some approaches over others.
Evaluating the practical performance of a specific library can be difficult due to various factors, such as the underlying elliptic curve, the proof system at hand, the arithmetization supported, or due to application-specific factors such as the desired security level.

**zk-Harness** is a benchmarking framework that aims to address these barriers by providing a unified
benchmark for standardized evaluation of existing libraries for zkSNARKS. 
It is designed to be easily extendable - libraries can be easily added and compared for standardized functionalities, whereas circuit developers can simply add their already developed circuit to evaluate its performance. 
zk-Harness provides benchmarks along the whole zkSNARK stack.
The backend for mathematical operations (field & curve) is inherited from [zka.lc](https://zka.lc/), a project from Michele OrrÃ¹ and George Kadianakis.
The benchmark results are hosted at [zk-bench.org](https://www.zk-bench.org).

### Circuit payloads supported by zk-Harness 

The current framework supports a set of payloads for each library.

## How to use

To run the benchmarks, you will first need to follow the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

To run *all* benchmarks for mathematical operations, run `make math`.

Run *test* benchmarks for end-to-end circuits, run `make circuits-test`.

To run *all* benchmarks for end-to-end circuits, run `make circuits`.

To keep logs for the runs you can use the `tee` command, e.g., `make circuits 2>&1 | tee logs`

### Add benchmarks for new circuits

zk-Harness is easily extensible and modular, which means that you should be able to integrate you own circuits with ease.
Each framework in `framework/<framework_name>` includes a detailed description on how to add a self-developed circuit that goes beyond the standard payloads already integrated.

### zk-Harness architecture and add support for new frameworks

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## How to contribute / TODOs

We aim to successively expand this list to further include benchmarks for other ZKP frameworks, more circuits, and recursive composition of proofs.

There are many ways in which you can contribute to the zk-Harness:

- [] Add benchmarks for circuits in an already integrated framework
- [] Integrate a new framework into the zk-Harness
- [] Integrate new math benchmarks in [zkalc](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/)
- [] Run existing benchmarks to additional machines
- [] Work on any open GitHub issue
- [] Propose new visualizations for the results
- [] Propose new benchmark categories, such as recursion benchmarking
